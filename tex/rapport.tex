The method promoted here is the Newton-Raphson algorithm, and the goal is to evaluate the assets and liabilities of such a solution. This shall be done by testing the method in different settings. In the following, you will be proposed a list of applications where this algorithm is necessary. You must program at least two of these applications, and then write a summary of your experiments as a conclusion. More applications are not synomyms of better work.} \sffamily }
